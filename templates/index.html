With good diabetes management and regular eye checks, you can maintain your eye health and reduce your risk of developing diabetic retinopathy in the future.`,

            1: `### **Precautionary Measures for Mild Diabetic Retinopathy**
> *At this early stage, proactive management can significantly slow or halt progression.*

1. **Routine Eye Examinations**
   - Schedule **dilated eye exams every 6 to 12 months** with a retinal specialist.
   - Monitor for subtle changes in retinal blood vessels or vision quality.

2. **Strict Blood Sugar Control**
   - Maintain **HbA1c below 7%** (or as advised by your physician).
   - Monitor blood glucose levels regularly and adhere to medication schedules.

   - Avoid smoking and limit alcohol intake.

5. **Medication Compliance**
   - Take all prescribed **anti-diabetic, anti-hypertensive, and lipid-controlling medications** as directed.

6. **Monitor Visual Changes**
   - Report symptoms like **blurriness, floaters, or dark areas** in vision immediately.

7. **Patient Education**
   - Understand the **progressive nature of DR** and the importance of early intervention.
   - Participate in **diabetes education programs** if available.

> **Forward-looking Insight:**  
By acting now, patients with Mild DR can delay or entirely prevent progression to more advanced, vision-threatening stages of diabetic retinopathy.`,

            2: `### **Precautionary Measures for Moderate Diabetic Retinopathy**
> *This stage requires more aggressive management to prevent vision loss.*

1. **Frequent Eye Examinations**
   - Schedule **dilated eye exams every 3 to 6 months** with a retinal specialist.
   - More frequent monitoring may be necessary depending on progression.

2. **Possible Medical Interventions**
   - Discuss with your ophthalmologist about **potential treatments** like laser therapy.
   - Early intervention can prevent progression to more severe stages.

3. **Aggressive Blood Sugar Management**
   - Work with your doctor to **optimize glucose control**.
   - Target HbA1c levels as recommended by your healthcare team.
   - Consider continuous glucose monitoring if available.

4. **Strict Blood Pressure & Lipid Control**
   - Maintain **blood pressure below 130/80 mmHg**.
   - Follow a **low-sodium diet** if recommended.
   - Take cholesterol medications as prescribed.

5. **Lifestyle Modifications**
   - Follow a **diabetic diet plan** developed with a nutritionist.
   - Engage in **approved physical activities** that don't increase eye pressure.
   - **Absolutely avoid smoking** and limit alcohol consumption.

6. **Regular Communication with Healthcare Team**
   - Report **any visual changes immediately**.
   - Coordinate care between your endocrinologist and ophthalmologist.

> **Important Note:**  
Moderate diabetic retinopathy is a critical turning point. With proper medical care and lifestyle management, you can significantly reduce the risk of vision loss.`,

            3: `### **Precautionary Measures for Severe Diabetic Retinopathy**
> *Immediate and comprehensive intervention is essential at this advanced stage.*

1. **Urgent Ophthalmological Care**
   - **Immediate consultation** with a retinal specialist is required.
   - Prepare for possible interventions like **laser photocoagulation** or **anti-VEGF injections**.
   - Follow-up examinations every **1 to 3 months** or as directed.

2. **Intensive Blood Sugar Control**
   - Work with your endocrinologist for **aggressive diabetes management**.
   - Consider adjustment of insulin regimen or medications.
   - **Frequent blood glucose monitoring** throughout the day.

3. **Critical Blood Pressure Management**
   - Maintain **strict blood pressure control** below 130/80 mmHg.
   - Daily blood pressure monitoring at home.
   - Medication adherence is absolutely essential.

4. **Activity Restrictions**
   - **Avoid heavy lifting** and strenuous exercises that can increase eye pressure.
   - Limit activities that involve rapid head movements.
   - Get clearance from your doctor before resuming normal physical activities.

5. **Symptom Vigilance**
   - **Immediately report** any changes in vision, including:
     - New floaters or flashes of light
     - Blurred or fluctuating vision
     - Areas of vision loss or shadows
     - Sudden vision changes of any kind

6. **Comprehensive Support**
   - Consider joining a **support group** for emotional and practical assistance.
   - Learn about **vision rehabilitation services** if needed.
   - Prepare home environment for safety if vision is compromised.

> **Critical Awareness:**  
Severe diabetic retinopathy poses a significant risk to vision. Immediate and consistent medical care is absolutely essential to preserve remaining vision.`,

            4: `### **Precautionary Measures for Proliferative Diabetic Retinopathy**
> *This is the most advanced stage requiring urgent and aggressive intervention.*

1. **Emergency Eye Care**
   - **Immediate treatment** is required - do not delay seeking care.
   - Prepare for interventions such as **vitrectomy**, **laser therapy**, or **anti-VEGF injections**.
   - **Frequent follow-ups** (potentially weekly or monthly) will be necessary.

2. **Hospital-Grade Blood Sugar Control**
   - Work with specialists for **intensive glycemic management**.
   - Your endocrinologist may recommend **hospitalization** for stabilization if control is poor.
   - Continuous glucose monitoring may be essential.

3. **Strict Medical Compliance**
   - Take **all medications exactly as prescribed**.
   - **Do not miss any appointments** with retinal specialists.
   - Report any medication side effects immediately rather than discontinuing.

4. **Visual Function Preservation**
   - Learn about **low vision aids and services** that may help.
   - Implement **home modifications** for safety if vision is compromised.
   - Consider **occupational therapy** for adapting to visual changes.

5. **Critical Symptoms Requiring Emergency Care**
   - **Sudden vision loss** - seek emergency room care immediately.
   - **Eye pain** - may indicate complications like neovascular glaucoma.
   - **Flashes of light** or numerous new floaters - may indicate vitreous hemorrhage.

6. **Mental Health Support**
   - Address **anxiety and depression** that commonly occur with vision-threatening conditions.
   - Consider **professional counseling** to cope with potential vision changes.

> **Urgent Priority:**  
Proliferative diabetic retinopathy is a medical emergency. With modern treatments, vision can often be preserved if intervention is immediate and comprehensive. Your adherence to medical recommendations directly impacts your visual outcome.`,
